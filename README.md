# PHP Unexpected Empty Array Return

This repository demonstrates a scenario where a PHP function unexpectedly returns an empty array, leading to unexpected behavior in the calling code. The issue arises from the way the function is handling the input array.

## Bug Description
The `processData` function is designed to process an input array and return the modified or processed array. However, due to a subtle error (explained below), this function returns an empty array instead of the expected processed array, causing the `foreach` loop to not iterate.

## Solution
The solution involves addressing the error in the way the input array is handled and returned in the function.
